# ⚡ Ohm’s Law Circuit Builder

## 📌 Project Overview

Ohm’s Law Circuit Builder is an interactive educational web application designed to help students learn basic electrical circuit concepts. The application allows users to build a simple circuit and observe how **Voltage (V)**, **Current (I)**, and **Resistance (R)** change in real time according to Ohm’s Law.

The simulator visually demonstrates the relationship:

[
V = I \times R
]

By adjusting circuit parameters, users can instantly see how electrical quantities vary, making it a useful learning tool for beginners in electronics and physics.

## 🧮 Ohm’s Law

Ohm’s Law defines the relationship between voltage, current, and resistance:

* **V (Voltage)** – Electrical potential difference
* **I (Current)** – Flow of electric charge
* **R (Resistance)** – Opposition to current flow

Formula:
[
V = I \times R
]
